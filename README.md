ti84-ref_app
==================

## Work in Progress

**Note** This repository is work in progress. The build system, file-naming and tool-poratability **all** need significant tuning. The basic stuff compiles and runs, but there are a lot of formalities to be done, including pics (images) and CI.

## ti84-ref_app

ckormanyos/ti84-ref_app creates a fully functioning reference application for the z80-based TI84-Plus monochrome graphics calculator.

The reference application contains a small blinky application supported by a (TBD) skinny multitasking scheduler.
This application has a complete C-runtime initialization based on and using the
free [`sdcc`](https://sdcc.sourceforge.net) toolchain.

## Building

TBD Supported on `Win*` and `*ninx`.

## Testing and Continuous Integration

## Images
